This demo will connect to your module after the user choose it out of a bluetooth list of devices, then will work as a terminal between unity and your module.

Note : TerminalController.cs escript is already attached to the 'InfoController' gameobject in the scene.

Warning : you need to alter the 'Name' or 'MacAdress' in the Awake() method in the script 'BasicDemo.cs' to match your module.
