1) Basic demo.
2) Automatic Connection.
3) Bluetooth Terminal.

Then choose whatever you want!

Note : The 'BtConnector' gameobject is added to everyscene, so no need to do this step. But you must not forget to move the 'Plugins' folder into the 'Assets' folder. you should have the directory'Assets/Plugins/...'
